I am a Ph.D. student specializing in Educational Technology at the University of California, Irvine, where I am advised by [Dr. Mark Warschauer](http://markwarschauer.com/) and [Dr. Penelope Collins](https://sites.google.com/uci.edu/penelopecollins/home). I also work closely with [Dr. Ying Xu](https://ying-xu.com/) from the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE). Prior to joining UCI, I obtained my master's degree in Language and Literacy from HGSE.

My research focuses on the intersection of child-computer interaction and education, with a particular emphasis on designing and evaluating conversational AI to promote young children's learning and parent-child joint engagement. 

I am currently working on two NSF-funded projects. In collaboration with PBS KIDS, I am involved in developing and evaluating conversational science videos aimed at fostering STEM learning among children. Additionally, I am exploring AI-assisted co-design of culturally relevant educational materials with teachers and families from diverse backgrounds and transforming these materials into interactive formats by embedding bilingual conversational agents.

As a mixed-methods researcher, I combine design-based implementation research with experimental designs. My approach involves close collaboration with young children and their families from diverse cultural backgrounds to create engaging and accessible conversational interfaces. In parallel, I design experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of these tools, integrating qualitative insights from the design phase with quantitative results from the evaluation.
