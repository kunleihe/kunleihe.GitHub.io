I am a Ph.D. student in Education at the University of California, Irvine, where I am advised by [Dr. Mark Warschauer](http://markwarschauer.com/). Prior to joining UCI, I completed my master's at Harvard Graduate School of Education. My research explores the intersection of **cutting-edge technologies** and **child development**, with a focus on creating innovative solutions to support children's learning.

My current research focuses on designing and evaluating **conversational technologies** to promote early learning, with a particular emphasis on **language and STEM development**. I am committed to creating learning experiences that are **inclusive and accessible** to children from diverse linguistic, cultural, and socio-economic backgrounds. 

I take a **human-centric design approach** to my work, often conducting playtests with young children and engaging in co-design with parents. I am dedicated to amplifying the voices of children and parents in technology design to improve the development of children and the well-being of families.
