## My research focuses on three main areas:

1. **Designing Conversational Interfaces to Promote Learning**: I design conversational interfaces, such as incorporating conversational agents in ebooks and child TV shows, to support children's language and STEM learning. By creating engaging and interactive learning experiences, I aim to make learning fun and accessible for all children.

2. **Evaluating the Learning Effects through Randomized Control Trials**: To test the effectiveness of these conversational interfaces, I conduct randomized control trials to evaluate their impact on children's learning outcomes. Through rigorous testing, I can determine whether the interfaces are meeting their intended goals and how they can be improved.

3. **Conducting Post-hoc Analysis of Child-Agent Interactions**: To gain deeper insights into children's interactions and engagement with the conversational interventions, I analyze the data collected from their interactions with the interfaces. This allows me to identify patterns and trends in children's learning and inform the design of future interventions.
