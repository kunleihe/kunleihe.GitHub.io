Our paper *“Rosita Reads With My Family”: Developing A Bilingual Conversational Agent to Support Parent-Child Shared Reading.* won the Best Paper Award at the Interaction Design and Children Conference this year. This project presents the development of a bilingual conversational agent and accompanying e-book, designed to support parent-child interactions and promote language development for Latinx Spanish-English bilingual children. Results from a user study indicate that the bilingual agent effectively engages children verbally and encourages parental involvement in reading processes. The study also provides design insights for creating conversational agents for bilingual children. Future directions including deploying the system at families' homes for an extended period of time and evaluating childrne's learning gains from using the system.
