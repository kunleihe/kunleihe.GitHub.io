I graduated from Harvard Graduate School of Education with a master's degree in Language and Literacy. During my master's, my research focused on social factors, particularly children's interactions with their caregivers and teachers, shape their language development in early years. 

I also co-founded "Button Baby", a start-up that produces accessible, meaningful, and engaging parenting resources rooted in educational research. Our start-up was awarded over $8,000 funds from venture programs at Harvard and MIT.ÃŸ
