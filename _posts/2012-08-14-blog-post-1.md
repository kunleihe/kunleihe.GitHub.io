I am glad to announce that I will be joining UCI School of Education as a Ph.D. student. I will be working with [Dr. Mark Warschauer](http://markwarschauer.com/) at the Digital Learning Lab on the Converse to Learn project, where I will be conducting research on designing and evaluating conversational technologies to promote children's language and STEM development.
