</div> <p> We developed a bilingual conversational agent embedded in the story reading interface, Rosita Reads with My Family, to support parent-child shared reading. Not only does Rosita engages children in back-and-forth conversations about the story plots to enhance story comprehension, Rosita also involves parents by providing discussion prompts that connect the story to children's life experience.</p><br>"

This project presents the development of **a bilingual conversational agent and accompanying e-book**, designed to support parent-child interactions and promote language development for linguistic minority children. Results from a user study indicate that the bilingual agent effectively **engages children verbally** and **encourages parental involvement** in reading processes. The study also provides design insights for creating conversational agents for bilingual children.
