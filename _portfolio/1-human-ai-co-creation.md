excerpt: "This project focuses on co-designing culturally sustaining educational materials that reflect students' diverse backgrounds with community members. It explores using generative AI to support teachers and families to efficiently develop these tailored materials, blending AI's generative capabilities with their cultural assests to produce inclusive, high-quality content for diverse classrooms and families."

## Teacher-AI Co-creation of Science Narratives
This study explores the co-creation of science instructional materials by teachers and AI, with a focus on how cultural considerations are integrated into this collaborative process. In summer 2024, I ran a month-long workshops with five teachers who serve predominantly Latine students in the early grades. In these workshops, they were guided to collaborate with generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and DALL-E to create science  storybooks that resonate with their students.

## AI-assisted Co-design of Bilingual Interactive Science E-books
This project involves co-designing 24 bilingual science e-books in collaboration with Latine families, integrating their cultural practices and knowledge. As a proof of concept for using AI to scale informal learning resources, families are guided to collaborate with AI to iteratively create and refine content including the stories, images, and discussion prompts, ensuring the stories resonate with the lived experiences of Latine communities. By utilizing participatory design techniques, this project ensures that the cultural values and practices of Latine families are central to the science content and dialogic reading experiences in these e-books.
