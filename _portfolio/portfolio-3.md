An emerging body of research has demonstrated the feasibility and potential learning benefits of AI-powered conversational agents that can converse contingently with children. However, despite these promising findings, no research has yet investigated how children interact with these agents quantitatively across a large dataset and how these interactions relate to their learning outcomes and their preceptions of the conversational agent. 

In this study, I aim to fill this gap by using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to explore the **patterns in children’s utterances** during interactions with a conversational agent embedded in a science video program. I will also investigate the **associations between these patterns and children’s science learning outcomes**, including their knowledge of scientific concepts and their ability to apply these concepts in new situations, along with their **perception of the agent**. 

By doing so, I aim to (1) better understand how conversational agents can be designed and used to support children’s learning in science and other domains, (2) enrich the theories on scaffolded science learning through guided conversations, and (3) curate a dataset of children’s scientific dialogue with a conversational agent.
