title: "Analyzing Children's Verbal Engagement with a Conversational Agent"
excerpt: "<img src='/images/conv-tech.png' width=300px height=200px style='float:right; margin-left:20px;'> This project is part of a larger study on using conversational AI to suppport children's science learning. We partnered with PBS KIDS to develop interactive science video programs in which the main character, powered by artificial intelligence, engaged children in conversations by asking them questions and providing responsive feedback. As part of the study, I analyzed children's verbal engagement with the conversational agent, including the relevance, accuracy, response rate, and response latency of their responses to the agent's questions and how it was related to children's science learing."

Our lab has collaborated with PBS KIDS to create interactive science video programs where the lead character, empowered by artificial intelligence, actively engages with children. In contrast to traditional animated shows like Dora the Explorer, where the character briefly pauses to ask a question and then offers a predetermined response regardless of the child's actual reply (a style we term "pseudo-interactive"), our "conversational videos" supports interactive verbal exchanges, allowing the media character to provide contingent feedback based on the child's responses.

As part of this broad study,  I examined children's verbal engagement with the conversational agent while they viewed the interactive videos as opposed to the pseudo-interactive ones. The interactive character seemed to bolster children's inclination to respond, while the pseudo-interactive seemed to deter engagement. This observation aligns with the broader understanding that children adjust their behavior towards conversational partners, whether human or virtual, based on their interaction experiences and perceptions.

## Highlights
We found that contingent interaction led to children steadily increasing their verbal engagement, whereas pseudo-interaction led to a steady decrease in engagement, as shown in the figure below. The interactive character seemed to bolster children's inclination to respond, while the pseudo-interactive seemed to deter engagement. This observation aligns with the broader understanding that children adjust their behavior towards conversational partners, whether human or virtual, based on their interaction experiences and perceptions.
